## What is Laminar?

Laminar is a tool that helps your engineering team build API integations in **1-2 days** instead of 1-2+ sprint cycles.

### Why are integrations hard?

API integrations don't add to your business' value proposition... but customers expect them.

Building an integration involves writing code to transform data of one format into another. This type of code is complicated and requires a lot of testing. Which means it can take engineers **1-2+ sprint cycles** to ship an integration.

Engineering hours are **expensive** and should be used to build product.

        Sometimes having the right integrations can be the difference between winning and losing a deal. But taking an engineer off building product features can be costly.

        The reason it can take so long is because there are a lot of things that need to be done:

        - **Data transformation**
            - Transforming data is the riskiest and most complicated part of building an integration. It's usually where things go wrong due to how complicated the code can be.
            - Efficent data transformation code is hard to write, and can be a performance bottleneck.
            - Every API has different data formats, which means the data transformation code needs to be written from scratch for every integration.
        - **Error handling**
            - Handling errors from the API you're integrating with is important, but it's hard to do well.
            - Anticipating all the different types of errors that can occur is hard.
            - Differences in API responses can cause your application to crash.
        - **Testing**
            - Writing tests for integrations require a lot of mocking.
            - Edge cases are not the easiest to find, and can be hard to reproduce/mock.
        - **Monitoring**
            - Understanding where issues are happening in your integration in production can be extremely time consuming if proper logging isn't in place.
            - Logging for every operation of an integration can be a lot of work, and can be hard to standardize across your application.
        - **Maintenance**
            - APIs change over time, and integrations need to be updated to reflect those changes.
            - This can take a lot of time, especially if the previous data transformation code was complicated.
        - **Authentication**
            - Different APIs require different types of authentication.
            - Authentication is a security risk, and needs to be done properly.

        Integrations are written in your application's codebase, which impact your application's performance due to the complexity of some of the data transformation code as you scale.

### How does Laminar help?

Laminar handles transforming data while it is being transferred. This means your engineers write **a fraction** of the code.

Engineers specify how data should be transformed in Laminar using operations written in **JSON**.

With less production code to write, engineers can ship integrations in **1-2 days** instead of 1-2+ sprint cycles.
