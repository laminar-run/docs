## What is Laminar?

Laminar is a platform that helps build and maintain custom [**API integrations**](/concepts/integrations) faster.

## How does it work?

### Send data in the format you want

Laminar acts as a middleware between your system and the API you want to integrate with.

![Laminar API Setup](https://github.com/laminar-run/public-assets/blob/main/pipeline-demo.gif?raw=true)

### Build workflows between APIs

Use workflows in Laminar to send and receive data between APIs based on your business logic.

### Transform data on the fly

Specify how data should be transformed between APIs in Laminar using operations written in [**Lam (Laminar's data transformation DSL)**](/lam/introduction).

```coffee
# JSON
# {                             ->   {  
#    "message": "Hello lam",            "message": "Hello lam",
#    "foo": "delete me",        ->      "status": "success"
#    "http_status": "200"               "timestamp": "2024-01-29T12:00:00Z"
# }                             ->   }

# Remove some fields
del(.foo)

# Add a timestamp
.timestamp = now()

# Parse HTTP status code into local variable
http_status_code = parse_int!(.http_status)
del(.http_status)

# Add status
if http_status_code >= 200 && http_status_code <= 299 {
    .status = "success"
} else {
    .status = "error"
}
```

## Watch a demo

Watch Laminar transform JSON data using a simple [**Flow**](/concepts/flows).

## Run integrations anywhere

Run data transformations on data from anywhere using the Laminar API.

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.laminar.run/flows/execute' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
     --data-raw '{
         "input": '{"message":"Hello lam","foo":"delete me","http_status":"200"}',
         "flowId": 10,
     }'
```
