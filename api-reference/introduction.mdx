# Laminar's REST API

Laminar's REST API allows you to build, update, and run Laminar flows from your own applications.

## Auth

Laminar uses `Bearer` authentication. You can get your bearer token by making a request to:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.laminar.run/auth/getToken \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email": "<your email>", "password": "<your password>"}'
```

Replace `<your email>` and `<your password>` with your Laminar credentials.

If you don't have a Laminar account, you can sign up [here](https://app.laminar.run/auth/signin).

## API

Laminar's REST API is available at `https://api.laminar.run`.

Make sure to pass the following headers with each request:

```javascript
{
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    'accept': 'application/json'
    'Authorization': 'Bearer <your token>'
}
```
