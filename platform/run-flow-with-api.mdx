To access Laminar's API endpoints, you need to obtain an authorization token. Laminar uses Bearer authentication, which means that you need to include the token in the `Authorization` header of your request.

Example:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.laminar.run/flows/execute \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Beaerer <token>' \
  --data '{
      "input": '{"message":"Hello lam","foo":"delete me","http_status":"200"}', 
      "flowId": "<flow id>"
    }'
```

### Get an Auth token

1. Make a POST request to the `/auth/getToken` endpoint.
2. Include the required request body in JSON format. The body should contain the necessary login credentials.
3. If the login is successful, you will receive a response with a status code of 200 and a token in the response body.

Store the token securely as it will be required for subsequent API requests.

For flow running purposes, we recommend using a **Runner Account**.

You can create a runner account by creating a new user in Laminar and inviting it to your Workspace. You can then use the runner account's credentials to obtain an auth token.

Example Request:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.laminar.run/auth/getToken \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "username": "<your runner account email>",
    "password": "<your runner account password>"
  }'
```

Example Response:

```json
{
  "access_token": "<token>",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": "3600",
  "refresh_token": "<token>"
}
```

### Run a Flow

1. Make a POST request to the `/flows/execute` endpoint.
2. Include the required request body in JSON format. The body should contain the flow ID and the input data.
3. If the flow is executed successfully, you will receive a response with a status code of 200 and the output data in the response body.
4. If the flow fails to execute, you will receive a response with a status code of 400 and the error message in the response body.
