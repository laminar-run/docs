Now that you have a Workspace and a Flow, you can run your Flow.

You can first run your flow without any data transformations with some simple input data.

We'll use the following input data:

```json
{                             
   "message": "Hello lam",   
   "foo": "delete me",     
   "http_status": "200"   
}                        
```

![Demo](https://github.com/laminar-run/public-assets/blob/main/Running%20An%20Empty%20Flow.gif?raw=true)

1. From your Workspace Dashboard, click **Create Flow** on the bottom left of the Flows table.
2. Give your Flow a name and a description and click **Create Flow**.
3. Add input data for the test by pasting the JSON above into the **Input** field.

We'll now add a simple transformation to our Flow.

```coffee
# Remove some fields
del(.foo)

# Add a timestamp
.timestamp = now()

# Parse HTTP status code into local variable
http_status_code = parse_int!(.http_status)
del(.http_status)

# Add status
if http_status_code >= 200 && http_status_code <= 299 {
    .status = "success"
} else {
    .status = "error"
}
```

Our Flow will take the input data and transform it into the following output data:

```json
{                             ->   {  
   "message": "Hello lam",            "message": "Hello lam",
   "foo": "delete me",        ->      "status": "success"
   "http_status": "200"               "timestamp": "2024-01-29T12:00:00Z"
}                             ->   }
```

![Demo](https://github.com/laminar-run/public-assets/blob/main/Run%20A%20Flow%20In%20Laminar.gif?raw=true)

3. In the Flow Editor, add a program to your Flow in Lam, and click **Update Flow**.
4. Click **Run Flow**, and you should see your transformed output data.

Amazing! ðŸŽ‰ You've just run your first Flow in Laminar.

Now you'll want to run your Flow with real data using Laminar's API.
