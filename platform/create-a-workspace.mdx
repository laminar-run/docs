In order to run Flows and build workflows for your integrations, you'll need to create a Workspace.

1. If you're just getting started, you'll be prompted to create a Workspace when you sign up for Laminar.

If you already have a Workspace, you can create a new one by navigating to the [**Workspaces** panel](https://app.laminar.run/workspaces) on the Laminar platform and clicking the **Create Workspace** button.

2. Give your Workspace a name and click **Save**.
3. Tada ðŸŽ‰ You've created a Workspace! You can now start building Flows and workflows for your integrations.

By default, you'll be redirected to your preferred Workspace when you log in to Laminar. You can change your preferred Workspace by navigating to the [**Workspaces** panel](https://app.laminar.run/workspaces) on the Laminar platform and clicking the **Set as Preferred** button next to the Workspace you'd like to set as your preferred Workspace.

4. You can invite your team members to your workspace by navigating to the **Settings** tab on the Laminar platform.
