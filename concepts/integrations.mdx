## What are integrations?

Integrations are a way to connect your application to other applications and services. They allow you to send and receive data from other applications and services.

## API integrations are painful to build.

- Writing code to transform data of different formats is complicated and error prone; and
- Managing different integration workflows based on arbitrary system state can quickly become a nightmare to maintain.

### Custom integrations are required.

- Normally in order to close deals with customers, integrations to their existing systems are required.
- No two systems are the same, so custom business logic is always required to make sense of the data coming from external tools.

### Integration suites are hard to maintain.

Integration suites are ever growing and hard to maintain, and require a lot of engineering time to build and maintain.
