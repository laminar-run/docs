## What are Flows?

Flows are data transformation jobs that run on Laminar.

Each Flow has a program that can be executed, which can be modified at any time.

Programs are written in [**Lam (Laminar's data transformation DSL)**](/lam/introduction).

Flows can be executed by calling the [**Laminar API**](/platform/run-flow-with-api).

## Input

Flows take an input when they are executed. This input is a JSON object that will be transformed by the Flow's program.

## Versioning

Every update to a Flow is versioned. This means that you can always go back to a previous version of a Flow.
