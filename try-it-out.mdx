## Overview of the Test

Here's a quick overview of what you'll be doing in this test:

- **Login**: Signing in as `demo@laminar.run`.
- **Initial Payload**: Making a GET Request to [https://source.test.laminar.run/](https://source.test.laminar.run/) to see what the payload looks like before Laminar transforms it en route.
- **Run a Flow**: Running a Flow that was predefined on `demo@laminar.run`'s account that renames `description` to `new_field1` in transit (i.e. before the response from Laminar arrives.)

> **Note**: This is a super simple example. Laminar supports more than just the `rename_key` operation, and there are different `flow_types` you can learn about from our **Concepts** (ðŸš§ under construction ðŸš§) section of the documentation.

## Behind the Scenes

Here's an explanation of what happened behind the scenes to make this work using the Laminar API:

- **Account Creation**: We first had to create an Account.
- **Workspace Setup**: With that account, we created a Workspace and an API key for that workspace.
- **Node Creation**: We then created a Node for the Source we wanted to GET data from.
- **Flow Creation**: We then created a Flow that would GET data from the Source Node, and rename the `description` key to `new_field1` in transit.

### Creating a Node 

*(A definition of an API in Laminar)*. 

Once we created our workspace, we defined the Source Node for the Flow we wanted to execute.

> Here's the payload we sent to `/nodes/workspaces/:workspace_id` to create our Node. [You can read more about flow types here](#) (ðŸš§ under construction ðŸš§).


```JSON
{
    "node": {
        "url": "https://source.test.laminar.run/",
        "description": "Our Example Source Node",
        "name": "ex-source-node",
        "metadata": {
            "auth": {
                "type": "none"
            },
            "headers": {
                "Accept": "application/json",
                "Content-Type": "application/json"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Creating a Flow 

*(A definition of the operation that Laminar should execute)*

- **Initial Steps**: Now that we'd created our Node, we could then begin to define our Flow.
- **Flow Type**: In our case, we want to use a Flow with a `flow_type` of `pulley`, since we want to get data from a source, transform it, and then respond with the transformed data.

> Here's the payload we sent to `/flows/workspaces/:workspace_id` to create our Flow. [You can read more about flow types here](#) (ðŸš§ under construction ðŸš§).

```JSON
{
    "flow_type": "pulley",
    "flow": {
        "description": "Demo Pulley Flow.",
        "name": "pulley-flow",
        "mapping": {
            "operation_type": "pulley",
            "source": {
                "name": "ex-source-node",
                "fields": [
                    {
                        "name": "description"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "id"
                    }
                ]
            },
            "destination": {
                "name": "none"
            },
            "operations": [
                {
                    "type": "map",
                    "params": {
                        "function": "rename_keys",
                        "input": {
                            "from": "description",
                            "to": "new_field1"
                        }
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

### Executing the Flow.

We can then execute the flow by sending a POST request to `/flows/run/:flow_id`, with our `api_key` in the body of the request.

Here's what the data looks like before it's transformed by Laminar.

```JSON
{
  "data": {
    "description": "Hello World!",
    "id": "1"
  }
}
```

Here's an example response from the exectution of our Flow.

```JSON
{
  "data": {
    "completed_at": "2023-09-07T02:38:39Z",
    "id": "3a492878-4cfa-4e58-a3cf-6633f4da7529",
    "result": {
      "id": "1",
      "new_field1": "Hello World!"
    },
    "started_at": "2023-09-07T02:38:39Z",
    "status": "completed"
  }
}
```
